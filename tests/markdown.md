Markdown test
=============

Description
-----------

This test is meant to convert a Markdown file into:

 * a manual page, or
 * an HTML page, or
 * a PDF.

Ordered lists can be illustrated too:

1. One
1. Two
1. Three

And so can links like <https://www.defora.org/> or [with
labels](https://www.defora.org/).

Acknowledgments
---------------

This test would be nothing without the following code:

```shell-session
$ while true; do make || break; continue; done
```

While there, let us also have a word for the obvious:

```html
'"><h1>XSS
```

Conclusion
----------

This paragraph ends the test with a quote:

> All is well that ends well!

> [...]

> Definitely Italian.
